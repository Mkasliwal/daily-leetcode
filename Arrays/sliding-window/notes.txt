Basic format for static sliding window of size "k"-
Let suppose-
  an array - arr
  two iterators -i,j (keep track of starting and ending of window)
  window size - k

Format-
  while(j<arr.size()){
    //some "calculations"
    if(j-i+1<k)
      j++;
    else if(j-i+1==k){
      //1. we need to find the results from "calculations"
      //2. Slide the window
    }
  }
