## _Description_ 
Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.

An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121 is palindrome while 123 is not.

## _Example 1_
Input: x = 121

Output: true

## _Example 2_
Input: x = -121

Output: false

Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

## _Constraints_
- -2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1
