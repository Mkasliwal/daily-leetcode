## _Description_ 

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

## _Example 1_

Output: [0,1]

Output: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

## _Example 2_

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6

Output: [0,1]

## _Constraints_
- 2 <= nums.length <= 104
- -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
- -109 <= target <= 109
- Only one valid answer exists.

## _Bonus_
- Algorithm should be in less than O(n^2)
